# Big Data Taxi Analysis 🚖

This project shows how I applied **big data tools** to analyze taxi trip information using **Hadoop MapReduce**.

## 📂 What it does
- **Trip insights**: Finds short, medium, and long trips for each taxi, and calculates fares.  
- **Clustering**: Groups trips by drop-off location to identify travel patterns.  
- **Company comparison**: Counts trips for each taxi company and ranks them.  

## ⚙️ How it runs
- Written in **Python**.  
- Runs on **AWS EMR** (cloud-based Hadoop).  
- Uses **shell scripts** to launch each task.  

## 🛠️ Tech Used
- Python  
- Hadoop Streaming  
- AWS EMR (cloud execution)  

## ✨ Why this matters
This project demonstrates the ability to:  
- Work with **large datasets**.  
- Use **cloud and big data technologies**.  
- Produce **business insights** from raw data.
